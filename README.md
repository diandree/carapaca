# _Shell_ Remota Segura (_codenamed_: CARAPAÃ‡A)
This project aims to build a client/server architecture system that mimics Secure Shell. The system will have a server application and a client application. Once it is running, the server application accepts connections from client applications, authenticates users registered in the system, establishes session keys, and allows the client to submit commands on the host machine.
